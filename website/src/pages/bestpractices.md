**Upcoming DEI Best Practices Toolkits**  

FINOS is excited to announce the development of new best practices toolkits aimed at empowering organizations and individuals to embed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) into every aspect of their work. These toolkits are designed to provide practical, actionable guidance to help you foster an inclusive culture, break down systemic barriers, and create equitable opportunities in your workplace and the broader open source ecosystem.  

Each toolkit will include customizable templates, real-world case studies, and step-by-step strategies tailored to various roles and organizational contexts. Whether you're a team leader looking to enhance recruitment practices, a project contributor seeking to promote inclusive collaboration, or a decision-maker aiming to scale DEI initiatives, these resources are crafted to support your journey.  

Stay tuned as we launch these toolkits and share them on this platform. Together, we can create a thriving, inclusive ecosystem that benefits everyone.
